2. What AlexBot 4 Does Access

AlexBot 4 accesses limited data necessary for moderation:

Usernames & User IDs (for identifying and tracking moderation activity)

Message Content (only within public server channels where the bot is present)

Server ID and Channel ID

Timestamps of messages and actions

All checks are performed in real-time. No content is saved or used beyond moderation purposes.

5. Translation and Text Analysis

AlexBot 4 offers translation and cipher tools. Inputs provided to these tools are processed locally on the server running the bot and never transmitted elsewhere.

6. User-Initiated Commands

User commands (e.g., /;START:, ;translate) are handled in real-time. No data is retained beyond:

Immediate response generation

Internal temporary analysis (if needed)

7. Access Control

Only server staff (as defined by role) or the server owner can:

AlexBot 4 uses user role checks to verify permissions.

Server owners can configure the following:

Whether to log actions

Whether to enable age-detection moderation logic

Whether to allow translation commands

This allows full control over privacy-related behavior.
